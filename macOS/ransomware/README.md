# Ransomware

This baD-USB payload is gonna encrypt the Desktop, leving visible only a README file where u can write whatever you want, the encription can be "cancelled" using a password that you can set.
For sure you can modify as you like the script to encrypt other directories, changing the inside and the position of the README file (make an image instead of a txt for example), and the password also.
